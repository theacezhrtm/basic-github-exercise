    <h2>Name</h2>
    <p>My name is Helena Rica T. Mahinay. The name "Helena" means "pretty," <br> 
        inspired by the story of Helen of Troy, who was celebrated for her beauty. <br>
        "Rica" is derived from the Spanish word for "rich," symbolizing wealth or abundance.</p>

    <h2>Role</h2>
    <p>My first choice of role is UI/UX designer, and my second is backend developer. 
        I chose UI/UX design as my primary focus because the design is the first thing a person notices, 
        and the user experience (UX) flow directly impacts usability.<br>
        <br>Regardless of how well-written the code is, a poor design can make an application appear unprofessional. 
        As someone who has a keen eye for design and values aesthetics, I believe this field aligns perfectly with my strengths and interests. 
        Additionally, UI/UX design plays a crucial role in creating accessible, user-friendly interfaces, which greatly influence a product's success.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi there! My name is Helena. I dream of working from home, which is why I chose my course in the first place. 
        I want the freedom to travel anywhere and do the things I love without being tied down to a traditional job.
        Not many people know this, but here’s an unexpected fun fact about me: I worked in real estate for a year before deciding to shift careers. 
        <br> <br>I initially studied graphic design because I loved creating and designing, but I realized it wasn’t the right fit for me. 
        While I enjoy designing things that match my own taste, I struggled to feel satisfied when my work didn’t align with a client’s preferences.
        <br><br>So, I decided to explore another career path and delved into SEO. It was during this time that I discovered how broad and dynamic the industry is. 
        I learned about the different roles involved and was mesmerized by the work of coders. 
        That’s when I discovered programming and realized it was my true passion. 
        Now, I’m pursuing programming as it aligns perfectly with my dream career.</p>
